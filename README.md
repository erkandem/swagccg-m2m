# swagccg_m2m

*MatLab only client code generator for swagger (OpenAPI 2.0). Using MatLab. For MatLab*

## Summary

Immediately testing new resources is important if resources are going to be 
co-dependent. While the tools at SwaggerHub are mind blowing 
they may represent an overkill for *not yet production* code.
Typing a single query can be done in any browser or with tools like ``curl``.
This tool aims to place itself between those two extreme categories. 

## Installation

### 1. Download the User Distribution

Releases are published on GitHub and mirrored on the file-exchange. 
If you have trouble related to ``newline`` try a ``git clone``.

 I. Download the user distribution from GitHub
    ``https://github.com/erkandem/swagccg-m2m/releases/latest``
  
 II. Unzip it
 
 III. Run the ``swagccg_m2m_setup``. It will put static files like the template,
      the creation script and a zip file with client dependencies
      in location of your choice and add them to search path.

### 2. MPM

ðŸš¨ **not yet**

```MATLAB
mpm install swagccg-m2m
```

### 3. git clone 

 I. Clone it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erkandem/swagccg-m2m.git tmpdir
```
 II. create a user distribution ``swagccg_m2m_package``
 
 III. change to ``../packages`` 
 
 IV. follow the steps 1.II
 
The ``git clone`` way  is rather for developers of this repo.
Nonetheless, running ``swagccg_m2m_package`` after cloning 
will package a ``user version``. Currently, all dependencies
are included in a .zip file.

## Getting Started 

###  Client Code Generation

Let's start with the usual.
```MATLAB
mkdir('playground');
cd('playground');
```

The ``swagccg_m2m`` assumes that a ``confi.json`` file is in 
your working directory. Below is an example of such a JSON-file. 
Create this file yourself or copy it from this location:

```matlab
confi_path = fullfile(fileparts(which('swagccg_m2m__init__')), 'examples', 'example_confi.json' );
```

#### confi.json
The ``swagger_path`` key accepts a file path or web URL
```JSON
{
  "swagger_path": "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json",
  "target_path": "PetStoreClient.m",
  "class_name": "PetStoreClient",

  "api_port_local": "5000",
  "api_url_base_local": "127.0.0.1",
  "api_protocol_local": "http",

  "api_port_remote": "80",
  "api_url_base_remote": "petstore.swagger.io",
  "api_protocol_remote": "https"
}
```

You can now call the code generator with:

```MATLAB
swagccg_m2m;
```

Or pass the path string.

```matlab
swagccg_m2m(confi_path);
```

So now check whether you got your client in your working directory.

### Client Code Usage

Take a look at the ``test`` and click your way  through section by 
section. Meanwhile you could use the Swagger User Interface
in parallel ``https://petstore.swagger.io`` to test the test.

```matlab
playbook_location = fullfile(fileparts(which('swagccg_m2m__init__')), 'tests', 'test_petstore_play_book.m');
copyfile(playbook_location, 'test_template.m');
edit test_template
```


###  a Word on JSON in MatLab

MatLab has a built-in function to encode and decode JSON objects 
to  MatLab types. The``paths`` object within  a  ``swagger.json`` 
API definition has characters like ``/`` or curly braces in case 
of path parameters like  ``/{pathParam}``. Obviously strings with 
these  characters are not valid variables or fieldnames in MatLab.
Therefore a version of ``loadjson`` from ``jsonlab`` was 
modified to  overcome that hurdle.


## Finally
ðŸš¨ **the tool is not designed to work out of the box for your project**

It's not that I don't believe in miracles. But I'd expect 
that you will need to work on the client code after generating 
the client code. Specifically, everything around *Authentication*.
This is because most of the swagger details are not parsed.

## gotchas
- authorization is likely to be a break-point
- most of the swagger details are not parsed
- data models and mapping is omitted but adaptable
- little to none ``HTTP status codes`` parsing
- assumes some knowledge on HTTP HEADER, BODY, METHODs
