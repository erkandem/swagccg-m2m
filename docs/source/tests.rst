Tests
------------
The primary test target would be the client code generation.
Instead, I focused on creating an example which will test the
client functionality against the perstore API.

``test_petstore_play_book`` could serve as a starting point to write your own tests.

.. autofunction:: swagccg.tests.test_petstore_play_book


Final notes on Tests
---------------------

The tests are incomplete and avoid MatLab built-in because the author is spoiled by PyTest.
